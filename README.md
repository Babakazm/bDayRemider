The Birthday Reminder App is a simple, web-based application designed to keep track of birthdays. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's perfect for anyone who wants to keep a handy list of birthdays without the complexity of a full-blown calendar app. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the basics of web development and for those who want a straightforward solution to remember birthdays.

Features
Add Birthdays: Easily add a person's name and their birthday.
View Birthday List: All added birthdays are displayed in a list on the main page.
Simple UI: A clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for anyone to use.
Local Data Storage: Birthdays are temporarily stored, allowing the list to persist across browser sessions (future enhancement).
How It Works
Users can add a birthday by entering the name and date into the respective fields and clicking the 'Add Birthday' button. The app then displays this information in a list format on the same page. The current implementation is simple and stores data in the browser's memory.

Future Enhancements
Persistent data storage (using local storage or backend integration).
Notifications for upcoming birthdays.
Editing and deleting birthday entries.
Integration with calendar applications.
Styling and UX improvements.
Getting Started
Clone the repository and open index.html in any modern web browser to start using the app. No additional setup or dependencies required.
